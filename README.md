# Project Overview

In this project, I predicted the winner of football matches in the Premier League using Machine learning.  

**Project Steps**

* Scrape match data using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas.  
* Clean the data and get it ready for machine learning using pandas.
* Make predictions about who will win a match using scikit-learn.
* Measure error and improve our predictions.
