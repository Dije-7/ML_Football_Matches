## Project Overview

In this project, I scraped the data of past 5 years for all EPL matches and then using it predicted the winner of football matches of the current season using Machine learning.  

**Project Steps**
.
* Scrape match data using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas.  
* Clean the data and get it ready for machine learning using pandas.
* Make predictions about who will win a match using scikit-learn.
* Measure error and improve our predictions.
